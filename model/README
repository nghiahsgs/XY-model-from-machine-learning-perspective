All types of input have the same pickle structure.

e.g.: Delta0.34_L12.pickle
Test data: run20.h5
pickle structure: 10 components
0: xy
1: angle (renorm from 0 to 1)
2: vortex
3: label
4: temperature
5: angle-vortex input
6: helicity
7: magnetization
8: activation of 32 FCN corresponding to a specific input
9: softmax output
